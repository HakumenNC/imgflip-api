# :grey_question:About

This an unofficial API attempt for [Imgflip](https://imgflip.com/). I'm a big fan of Imgflip community and wanted to have a custom and richer API than the official one, also for example, with [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) documentation., the ability to run in as a container, etc...

This API should open a variety of fun usages around Imgflip.



# :rocket:Getting Started

## :computer:Build and run API locally :

```
git clone https://github.com/adriens/imgflip-api.git
cd imgflip-api
mvn spring-boot:run
```
:whale: Docker image is coming soon.
