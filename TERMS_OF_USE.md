This API has been developped by ImgFlip fans who wanted to :

- make a tribute to Imgflip
- create new kind of experiences around Imgflip to better promote this great platform with great people
- learn new technologies while producing something cool

We are developing this on free time  evenings, cloudy week-ends and sometime holidays.

This API must be seen like a FanArt initiative.

We do not : 

- try to make money on what we created
- want someone to make money thanks to our API, except if Imgflip wants to monetize it

We are open to :

- new ideas
- rewards (a beer, some hardware or books)

Hope you'll have fun, please let us know.
